This project was requested by my college professors, and it has some requirements to be met, such as a dashboard, using only Python in the backend, etc. I'm taking advantage of this opportunity to create a project and test my knowledge. Since it's just a small project for college, I don't plan to put it into production. I chose to use the Python library called Flask because it's geared towards web applications and meets my needs well. I'm using Docker for the MySQL database and the MVC format.
